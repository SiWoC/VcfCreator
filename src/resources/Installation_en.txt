To run the program, proceed as follows:
- Unzip the file (which you probably have just done to read this)
- Run VcfCreator.jar (doubleclick and open with Java) or VcfCreator.bat. The program requires Java to run.
  If Java is not yet installed you can download it from http://www.java.com
- Select an input file.
- Select an output folder. If this folder does not exist it will be created.
  In this output folder a subfolder destinations will be created.
- Enter a Route prefix. This ensures that you can keep apart the different routes

  in the output folder / destinations.
